Behicles between 0.2-2.8 years have a moderate risk ranging from 4.6-7%. Vehicles of 3+ years have the lowest risk, but take into consideration that it has a smaller sample size. \n",

    "Think about it, if you buy a new car, odds are you are in debt and have to make payments for it. While you are legally required to have insurance on it, it still beneficial to make claims on it to cover any cost from any accident. Ex: I total a $45,750 truck and I still owe $25,777. I need insurance to cover most of it."
